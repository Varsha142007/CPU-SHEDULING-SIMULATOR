# CPU-SHEDULING-SIMULATOR
his project is a CPU Scheduling Simulator designed to visualize and compare various CPU scheduling algorithms used in operating systems. It implements FCFS, SJF (Preemptive &amp; Non-Preemptive), Priority Scheduling, and Round Robin. The simulator calculates average waiting time, turnaround time, and response time.
